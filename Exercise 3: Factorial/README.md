## Requirements

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MateusVS/Node-Mid-Dev-MDC-Test.git

```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## How to Run
To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run start
```

The program will prompt you to enter a number. Enter the number for which you want to calculate the factorial.

After entering the number, the program will calculate and display the factorial of that number.

## Example
Suppose you want to calculate the factorial of the number 5. You would enter the following value when prompted:

Enter a number: 5

The program will then display the factorial of 5:

Factorial of 5: 120

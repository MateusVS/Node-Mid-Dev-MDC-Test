# Exercise 8: Interest Calculation

## Description

Create a function that calculates the final value of an investment based on initial capital, interest rate, and investment time (in months). The program must prompt the user for these values and display the final value.

## Requirements

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MateusVS/Node-Mid-Dev-MDC-Test.git
```

```
cd Exercise\ 8\:\ Interest\ Calculation/
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## How to Run
To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run start
```

The program will prompt you to enter the following information:

Initial Capital: Enter the initial amount of money you want to invest.
Interest Rate: Enter the interest rate for the investment (e.g., 5 for 5%).
Investment Time (in months): Enter the duration of the investment in months.
The program will then calculate and display the final value of the investment.

## Example
Suppose you want to calculate the final value of an investment with an initial capital of $1000, an interest rate of 5%, and an investment time of 12 months. You would enter the following values when prompted:

Initial Capital: 1000
Interest Rate: 5
Investment Time (in months): 12
The program will then display the final value of the investment:

Final Value: $1795.85

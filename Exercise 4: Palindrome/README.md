# Exercise 4: Palindrome

## Description

Create a function that checks whether a word is a palindrome (that is whether it reads the same backwards and forwards). The program must ask the user for and inform whether or not it is a palindrome.

## Requirements

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org)
- TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MateusVS/Node-Mid-Dev-MDC-Test.git
```

```
cd Exercise\ 4\:\ Palindrome/
```

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## How to Run
To run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

```
npm run start
```

The program will prompt you to enter a word. Enter the word for which you want to check if it's a palindrome.

After entering the word, the program will inform you whether the entered word is a palindrome or not.

## Example
Suppose you want to check if the word "racecar" is a palindrome. You would enter the following value when prompted:

Enter a word: racecar

The program will then display the result:

The word "racecar" is a palindrome.
